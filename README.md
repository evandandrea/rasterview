# RasterView v1.5

[![Snap Status](https://build.snapcraft.io/badge/michaelrsweet/rasterview.svg)](https://build.snapcraft.io/user/michaelrsweet/rasterview)

RasterView is a CUPS, PWG, and Apple raster file viewing application. It
basically allows you to look at the raster data produced by any of the standard
CUPS RIP filters (cgpdftoraster, imagetoraster, pdftoraster, and pstoraster) and
is normally used to either test those filters or look at the data that is being
sent to your raster printer driver.

RasterView is provided as free software under version 2 of the GNU General
Public license.

## Requirements

If you plan on (re)compiling it, you'll need FLTK 1.3.x (http://www.fltk.org/)
and a C++ compiler.


## How to Compile

Run the following commands:

    ./configure
    make


## How to Use

The program is called "rasterview" on UNIX/Linux and "RasterView.app" on macOS.
Run the program and then open a raster file, or pass the filename on the
command-line.  You can view multiple files simultaneously.

The "test" subdirectory includes a script for generating raster data using the
standard RIP filters.  Run the following command for help:

    tools/maketestfiles.sh help
